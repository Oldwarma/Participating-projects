# This crate depends on multi-test and rand. These are not features in
# wasm builds of cosmwasm. Despite this crate only being used as a dev
# dependency, because it is part of the workspace it will always be
# compiled. There is no good way to remove a member from a workspace
# conditionally. As such, we don't compile anything here if we're
# targeting wasm.

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
